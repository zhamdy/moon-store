## Quick Start

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Server (port 3001)
cd server && npm run migrate && npm run seed && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Client (port 5173)
cd client && npm run dev
```

## Key Patterns

`client/src/` is three layers: `app/` (composition root — routing, shell, session wiring),
`features/` (nine domain slices), `shared/` (cross-cutting code, feature-agnostic). Full model,
dependency rules and diagrams: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### The nine slices (`client/src/features/<slice>/`)

| Slice | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `auth` | Login, session/auth store, route guard |
| `pos` | Point of sale, register, shifts, cart, held carts |
| `inventory` | Products, stock, categories, bundles, pricing |
| `sales` | Sales history, promotions, gift cards, layaway |
| `customers` | Customer records, feedback, segments |
| `purchasing` | Distributors, vendors, expenses, purchase orders |
| `fulfillment` | Deliveries, online orders, storefront |
| `analytics` | Dashboard, reports, exports, AI insights |
| `admin` | Users, settings, audit log, backup, branches |

### Where does a file go? (R5 placement checklist)

1. Used by two or more slices? → `shared/`.
2. Is it the app shell or composition root? → `app/`.
3. Otherwise → the one slice that uses it.
4. Another slice needs it? → export it from that slice's `index.ts`. Never import deeper
   (`@/features/other-slice/pages/...` is a lint error).
5. Colocate the test beside the unit.

Full checklist detail, the global string-coupling contract (persist keys, shared React Query keys,
duplicated Sidebar route strings, global i18n files), and slice split/merge criteria:
`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`.

## Testing

```bash
cd server && npm test          # pg-mem suites; real-PostgreSQL suites report as skipped
cd client && npm test
```

### Real-PostgreSQL suites

Concurrency and idempotency invariants (guarded relative writes, `FOR UPDATE`, unique-claim
races) cannot be proven on pg-mem — they need two genuinely concurrent connections. Those
suites use `describeWithPostgres` from `server/tests/support/realPostgres.ts` and run only
when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is set. Without it they **skip loudly**; they never pass silently.

```bash
# Option A — a PostgreSQL you already run locally: point at a throwaway database
createdb moon_store_test
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/moon_store_test npm test

# Option B — a disposable container (port 5433, so it clears a local 5432)
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/moon_store_test npm test
```

Each test file gets its own schema, migrated through the real migration runner and dropped
on teardown, so files cannot contaminate each other. The target database only needs `CREATE`
privileges. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) always sets `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and fails the
build if these suites were skipped.

## Git Workflow

- **Always branch from `main`** before starting a feature (`feature/xxx`, `fix/xxx`)
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Merge back via PR

## Build Warnings

Chunk size warning (>500KB) is expected for SPA bundle — safe to ignore.
